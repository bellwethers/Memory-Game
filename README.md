## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a version of a Memory Game project.  Primarily the JavaScript file would need to be edited if needed.

To get started, open `js/app.js` to edit my work.

I tried to make the deck easy to edit and replace. You only need to have one of each card and clones will be made. Create a game board (table) which holds the cards in position.
